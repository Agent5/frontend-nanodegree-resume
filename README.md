Udacity Project 2: Online Resume
=========================================

This is my Project 2 submission for the Udacity Front-end Developer Course. The image  below is the design mockup which I've used as a general pattern to create my online resume using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I've done a bit of restyling to personalize the design.

To view the project please:

1. Clone the repo to a local directory
2. CD into the directory
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Run 'grunt'
5. Open a browser to http://localhost:3000
